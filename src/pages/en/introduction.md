#### Frank V. Radomski and Sons, Inc
##### Revised June 1, 2021

Frank V. Radomski and Sons, Inc. is committed to providing and maintaining a safe
work environment and protecting the health of our employees, visitors to our jobs
and facilities, our customers, and the general public.

Hazard recognition, hazard evaluation, and hazard control are the guiding
principles used to identify and minimize safety and health risks to our company and
our employees.

When potential risks have been identified, the exposures associated with the risks
are evaluated by conducting appropriate monitoring, measurements, and work
practice observations to ensure that appropriate control procedures can be put in
place to protect the workers from injury or illness.

Exposure evaluation methods will follow all current and future federal, state, and
local regulatory requirements and accepted industrial hygiene practices for
monitoring and protecting worker health and safety.
